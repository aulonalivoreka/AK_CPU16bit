## Project in Computer Architecture Course

This repository contains a project that simulates a 16-bit single-cycle CPU using the Verilog hardware description language. For a comprehensive overview of the supported instructions and a detailed analysis of the CPU's components and their interactions, refer to the accompanying documents: [Detyra2-AKSD-2023.pdf](Detyra2-AKSD-2023.pdf) and [Raporti_Grupi10.docx](Raporti_Grupi10.docx).
